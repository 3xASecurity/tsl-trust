# TSL-Trust

TSL Trust is an application which was developed initially to meet the requirements of the EU Service directive and the requirement to validate EU signed documents supported by Trusted Lists (TSL). The code was produced as a result of Swedish government funded projects and is currently maintained by the Swedish E-Identification Board.

TSL Trust serves 2 main purposes.

- Administration of trust in services listed in national so called Trusted Lists.
- Signature validation based on the selection of trusted services.

The curent version is version **1.3**
